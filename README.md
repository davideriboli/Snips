# Snips

This repository (a horrible mess of files in Italian and English) collects the lines of code and procedures that I can never remember, even though I have to do them often.

A kind of personal notepad that I also post here, in case it might be useful to someone.

It is in the form of an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault: you can consult the files directly in markdown, or open the archive with Obsidian for off-line consultation and use of tags, search, and colored syntax.

If you can't understand the comic, you're looking at the wrong repo.
